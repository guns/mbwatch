He talks about simple things actually.

When you have any sort of immutable data structure and you want to change=
=20
it from multiple threads
you just must have a mutable reference which points to the current version=
=20
of that data structure.
Now, updates to that mutable reference are fundamentally serial. Whatever=
=20
synchronization
strategy you chose been that optimistic updates (atom) or queuing (agent)=
=20
or locks you inevitably
will have a contention on a large number of threads. When you will run on=
=20
that you will also
have hundred ways to solve a problem.=20

There is nothing magical about persistent data structures on multi-core=20
machines :)
