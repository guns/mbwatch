Shared memory is kind of a degenerate case of message-passing when you
think about cache-coherency protocols and such.  I'd argue erlang's
message-passing isn't inherently superior, but kind of obfuscates the issue.

What's the sequential fraction of an arbitrary erlang program, can you even
know (I don't know erlang, so I'm honestly asking)?

Shared memory pretty darn convenient, and we don't have hundred-core+ boxes
yet.
