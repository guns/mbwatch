Hi,

So the other day I came across this
presentation:http://www.infoq.com/presentations/top-10-performance-myths

The guy seems to be smart and know what he talks about however when at
0:22:35 he touches on performance (or lack of thereof) of persistent data
structures on multi-core machines I feel puzzled.

He seems to have a point but really does not back it with any details.
There is also a claim that STM does not cooperate well with GC. Is it true?

Thanks,
Andy
