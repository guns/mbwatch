Well, yes it's a lie, it's an abstraction, we love those as programmers
:-).  The question is, is it worth the trouble and under what conditions?

IMO, we don't understand message passing well enough to be great at
programming or characterizing distributed concurrent systems.  I wonder how
this changes when you're writing erlang.  I would guess that certain
classes of programs are really easy to write in erlang compared to other
languages, and I wonder at what cost?

Clojure appealed to me because I was studying computer architecture in grad
school, and I think it has a great answer for cores<100 shared-memory
concurrency, but at some point I acknowledge that might not be good enough.

I'm very interested in Netkernel's approach, actually:
http://www.1060research.com/products/
It sort of marries the notion of immutable data with distribution and
message passing.  URLs as pointers.
